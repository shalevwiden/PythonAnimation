## Creating a stop motion animation with Matplotlib

Essentially, this project creates many pie charts in a folder using the `makedynamicpiecharts()` function.
Then it opens them simultaneously with a delay with `animate()`.

I've posted videos I've made from this project at -insert link-.

This project was a huge learning experience. With challenge after challenge, making me realize I needed more specific code. Learned lamda alot better to sort the list of images so they would open in order.
I also created a map degrees function that would simulate going around a circle with `rotateval` of incrementation and `count` of amount of times.
